# MYYOOMI-Discord-Bot-Announcer

MYYOOMI Discord Bot Announcer in Python. This project uses Bootstrap.

## Setup

1. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Open the `.env` file. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
   - Add your Discord bot token:
     ``` 
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your_token_here>
     ```

2. **Set Up Server:**
   - The bot runs on `0.0.0.0` at port `5709` by default.
   - You can edit the port in the `app.py` file (line 176).

## Starting the Bot

```bash
python app.py
```

I hope this helps! If there's anything more you need, feel free to let me know.
